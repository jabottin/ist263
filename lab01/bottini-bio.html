<body>
My name is Joseph (Joey) Bottini. I am a dual major studying Television Radio & Film in Newhouse as well as Information Management and Technology un the iSchool. I am interested in working in Sports Media and Management, specifically in representation. I have many skills in the communication realm specifically in social media, newswriting, marketing, production, and editing, event planning and outreach. Outside of work I love to be out socially, watch sport games with friends, root for my favorite teams like the Phoenix Suns and Cardinals, and watching movies and films regularly.
